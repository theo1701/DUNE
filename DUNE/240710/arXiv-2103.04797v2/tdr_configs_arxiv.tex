\begin{abstract}
  The Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is a next-generation long-baseline
  neutrino oscillation experiment consisting of a high-power, broadband neutrino beam,
  a highly capable near detector located on site at Fermilab, in Batavia, Illinois,
  and a massive liquid argon
  time projection chamber (LArTPC) far detector located at the 4850L of Sanford
  Underground Research Facility in Lead, South Dakota. The primary scientific goals
  of the experiment are precise measurements of all the parameters governing long-baseline
  neutrino oscillation in a single experiment, sensitivity to observation of neutrinos
  from a core collapse supernova, and sensitivity to physics beyond the Standard Model,
  including baryon number violating processes.
  DUNE has evaluated expected sensitivity to these physics objectives; these results and
  the details of the simulation studies that have been performed to evaluate these sensitivities
  are presented in the DUNE Physics TDR \cite{Abi:2020evt}.
  The long-baseline physics sensitivity calculations presented in the DUNE TDR,
   and in a related physics paper \cite{Abi:2020qib},  
  rely upon
  simulation of the neutrino beam line, simulation of neutrino interactions in the near
  and far detectors, fully automated event reconstruction and neutrino classification,
  and detailed implementation of systematic uncertainties.
  The purpose of this posting is to provide a simplified summary of the
  simulations that went into this analysis to the community, in order to facilitate
  phenomenological studies of long-baseline
  oscillation at DUNE. Simulated neutrino flux files and a GLoBES configuration describing
  the far detector reconstruction and selection performance are included as ancillary files to
  this posting. A simple analysis using these configurations in GLoBES
  produces sensitivity that is similar, but not identical, to the official DUNE sensitivity.
  DUNE welcomes those interested in
  performing phenomenological work as members of the collaboration, but also recognizes
  the benefit of making these configurations readily available to the wider community.

\section{Introduction}
The physics volume of the Technical Design Report (TDR)\cite{Abi:2020evt}  for the Deep Underground Neutrino
Experiment (DUNE) describes the proposed physics program for DUNE and the results of simulation
studies that have been performed to quantify DUNE's sensitivity to its physics objectives.
The primary scientific objectives of DUNE are
to study long-baseline neutrino oscillation to determine the neutrino mass ordering, to determine whether
CP symmetry is violated in the lepton sector, and to precisely measure the parameters governing neutrino
oscillation to test the three-neutrino paradigm. The DUNE physics program also includes precise measurements
of neutrino interactions, sensitivity to supernova burst neutrinos, and searches for a range of physics
beyond the Standard Model, including sensitivity to baryon number violating processes.


The long-baseline physics sensitivity calculations presented in the DUNE TDR
and the related physics paper \cite{Abi:2020qib}
are based upon detailed
simulations of the neutrino beamline and neutrino interactions in the near and far detectors.
To determine the expected physics sensitivities, a full analysis of simulation data is performed, including
automated signal processing, low-level reconstruction, energy reconstruction, and event classification.
This posting provides the results of some of these simulations for use by
anyone in the community interested in studying long-baseline neutrino oscillation in DUNE.
Simulated neutrino flux files and a GLoBES configuration describing
the far detector reconstruction and selection performance are included as ancillary files to
this posting. On arXiv, the ancillary files may be downloaded individually or as
a gzipped tar file.
The DUNE collaboration requests that any results making use of these files
reference this arXiv posting and the paper
describing the TDR long-baseline oscillation analysis\cite{Abi:2020qib}.

A detailed treatment of systematics, based on the expected variations of individual systematic parameters
describing uncertainties in flux, neutrino interactions, and detector effects, is included in full analysis.
However, for the GLoBES files included in this posting, only simple normalization uncertainties are implemented.
It is important to note that the configurations
provided here are not sufficient to fully reproduce the sophisticated analysis presented in the DUNE
TDR. Rather these configurations provide a simplified summary of the simulation, reconstruction, and
event selection aspects of that analysis as a common starting point for phenomenological studies.
The text in this document is not intended to provide thorough documentation of the details of how the
TDR results were produced; that is provided in the TDR text.
Rather we attempt to briefly summarize the analyses that produce these configurations and
provide documentation of how the configurations may be used.

In Section~\ref{sect:flux}, we describe the simulated fluxes for the LBNF beamline design considered by
the TDR, at both the near and far detectors, in both forward horn current (FHC) and reverse horn current (RHC)
modes. These flux files are provided in the ancillary files in a directory called dune\_flux/.
In Section~\ref{sect:xsec}, we describe the neutrino-nucleus interaction model implemented in the TDR
analysis.
In Section~\ref{sect:ana}, we briefly describe simulation, reconstruction, and selection of the expected event
samples in the far detector.
The results of the far detector analysis and a greatly simplified treatment of systematic uncertainties
after constraint by the near detector are provided in the ancillary files in a directory called
dune\_globes/, containing a GLoBES\cite{globes1,globes2} configuration, which is described in
Section~\ref{sect:globes}.


\section{Flux Simulation}
\label{sect:flux}
The neutrino fluxes used in the TDR were produced using G4LBNF, a Geant4\cite{GEANT4:NIM,GEANT4}-based
simulation of the LBNF beamline from primary proton beam to hadron absorber. Specifically, G4LBNF
version v3r5p4 was used, which was built against Geant4 version 4.10.3.p03.
All simulations used the QGSP\_BERT physics list.

G4LBNF is highly configurable to facilitate studies of a variety of beam options.  
The simulation was configured to use a detailed description of the LBNF optimized beam design \cite{beamcdr}.
That design starts with a 1.2-MW, 120-GeV primary proton beam that impinges on a 2.2m long, 16mm diameter
cylindrical graphite target. Hadrons produced in the target are focused by three magnetic horns operated
with 300kA currents. The target chase is followed by a 194m helium-filled decay pipe and a hadron absorber.
The focusing horns can be operated in forward or reverse current configurations, creating neutrino and
antineutrino beams, respectively. As described in \cite{Abi:2020evt}, this design was motivated by a genetic
algorithm used to optimize for CP-violation sensitivity.
The output of the genetic algorithm was a simple design including horn conductor and target shapes,
which was transformed into the detailed conceptual design simulated here by LBNF engineers.
A visualization of the focusing system, as simulated in G4LBNF, is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:beam_vis}.

\begin{figure}[!htpb]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{beam_vis.png}
  \caption{Visualization (C. Crowley, FNAL) of the three-horn focusing system simulated to produce the
    neutrino fluxes used in
  the DUNE TDR and included as an ancillary file with this article.}
  \label{fig:beam_vis}
\end{figure}

The basic output of G4LBNF is a list of all particle decays to neutrinos that occur anywhere along the beamline.
Weights (historically referred to as “importance weights”) are used to reduce the size of the output files by
throwing out a fraction of the relatively common low-energy neutrinos while preserving less numerous
high-energy neutrinos.
To produce neutrino flux distributions at a particular
location, all of the neutrinos in the G4LBNF output file are forced to point toward the specified location and
weighted according to the relative probability that the decay in question would produce a neutrino in
that direction\cite{pavlovic_thesis}.

Fluxes are provided at the center of the near detector (ND), located 574~m downstream
of the start of Horn 1, and
at the far detector (FD), located 1297~km downstream of the start of Horn 1.  Fluxes are available for both
neutrino or ``forward horn current'' mode (FHC) and
antineutrino or ``reverse horn current'' mode (RHC).
The simulated flux distributions at the far detector are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:beam_flux}.
Each flux is available in two formats: a root file containing flux histograms and a
GLoBES flux input file.  The root files also contain neutral-current and charged-current spectra,
which are obtained by multiplying the flux by GENIE 2.8.4
inclusive cross sections. The flux histograms in the root files have units of neutrinos/$\mathrm{m^2}$/POT.
Note that these histograms have variable bin widths, so discontinuities in the number
of events per bin
are expected.
The GLoBES flux files have units of neutrinos/GeV/$\mathrm{m^2}$/POT. These text files are in the standard
GLoBES format, in which the seven columns correspond to:
$E_{\nu}, \Phi_{\nue}, \Phi_{\numu}, \Phi_{\nutau}, \Phi_{\nuebar}, \Phi_{\numubar},
\mathrm{and} \, \Phi_{\nutaubar}$. The GLoBES far detector flux files are also included as part of the
provided GLoBES configuration.

\begin{figure}[!htpb]

    and antineutrino,
    RHC, beam running (right). Figure reproduced from \cite{Abi:2020qib}.}
  \label{fig:beam_flux}
\end{figure}

DUNE plans to measure the flux at various off-axis angles in order to access different neutrino
energy spectra and use this information to reduce the model dependence of the mapping between true
and reconstructed neutrino energy; this concept is referred to as
DUNE PRISM. Flux histograms at off-axis angles have been generated, but are not included in the ancillary
files for this posting. These additional flux files may be found at \cite{lauraspage}.

\section{Cross-Section Simulation}
\label{sect:xsec}

A model describing neutrino interactions has been implemented in v2.12.10 of the GENIE
generator \cite{Andreopoulos:2009rq,Andreopoulos:2015wxa}.
Event weights are applied to parameterize cross-section corrections not implemented in this
version of GENIE.
For true charged current quasi-elastic (CCQE) interactions, the shape of the four momentum
transfer is altered according to a
model of the nuclear weak charge screening (RPA) calculated by the Valencia
group \cite{PhysRevC.72.019902}, which results in a strong suppression at low four momentum transfer.
In addition, the rate of resonant and non-resonant single pion production is modified according
to deuterium bubble chamber tunes \cite{Rodrigues:2016xjj}.
The resulting charged-current cross section as a function of energy is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:xsec}.
For more discussion on the interaction model, the reader is directed to \cite{Abi:2020qib}.
NUISANCE \cite{Stowell:2016jfr} is used to apply weights from the DUNE reweighting framework
to GENIE events and
calculate the total cross sections; this output is used to produce the cross-section text files
included in the GLoBES configuration supplied with this article.
These cross-section text files are in the standard GLoBES format, in which the seven columns correspond to:
$log_{10}E_{\nu}, \sigmahat_{\nue}, \sigmahat_{\numu}, \sigmahat_{\nutau}, \sigmahat_{\nuebar}, \sigmahat_{\numubar}, \mathrm{and} \,
\sigmahat_{\nutaubar}$,
where $\sigmahat(E) = \sigma(E)/E[10^{-38}\frac{\mathrm{cm}^2}{\mathrm{GeV}}]$.
Note that the $\nu_{\tau}$ cross sections are set to zero in these files.

\begin{figure}[!htpb]

  \caption{Charged current neutrino interaction cross sections in the DUNE interaction model as
    a function of true neutrino energy. The CC inclusive (black) curve shows the cross-section
    values included in the GLoBES configuration. The blue and orange filled regions show the
    unoscillated and oscillated, respectively, $\numu$ flux at the far detector for reference.}
  \label{fig:xsec}
\end{figure}

\section{Monte Carlo Analysis}
\label{sect:ana}
As described in \cite{Abi:2020qib}, a full analysis and event selection has been performed on simulated
far detector data.
Simulated data is generated using the flux and cross-section simulation tools described in
the previous section and a Geant4\cite{Agostinelli:2002hh} simulation of the DUNE far detector.

The electronics
response to the ionization
electrons and scintillation light is simulated to produce digitized signals in the wire planes and
photon detectors (PDs) respectively. 
Raw detector signals are processed using algorithms to remove the impact of the LArTPC
electric field and electronics response from the measured signal, to identify hits, and to form clusters of hits
that are matched to form high-level objects such as tracks and showers.

The energy of the incoming neutrino in
charged-current (CC) events is estimated by adding the lepton and hadronic energies reconstructed using the
Pandora toolkit \cite{Marshall:2013bda,Marshall:2012hh}. If the event is selected as $\numu$ CC,
  the muon energy is is estimated from range
of the longest track if it is contained in the detector and from multiple Coulomb scattering if it exits the
detector. Electron and hadron energies are measured calorimetrically, with corrections applied to each hit
charge for recombination and the electron lifetime. An additional correction is made to the hadronic energy to
account for missing energy due to neutral particles and final-state interactions. In the energy range of
$0.5$ to $4$~GeV that is relevant for oscillation measurements, the observed neutrino energy resolution at the far detector
is $\sim$15 to 20\%, depending on lepton flavor and reconstruction method. It is expected that this resolution
could be improved using more sophisticated reconstruction techniques, but those improvements are not
considered in the analysis presented in \cite{Abi:2020qib} or in the GLoBES configurations provided here.

Event classification is carried out through image recognition techniques using a convolutional neural network,
named convolutional visual network (CVN). A detailed description of the CVN architecture is available in
\cite{Abi:2020xvt} and the performance is discussed in \cite{Abi:2020qib}. CVN scores for each interaction
to be a $\numu$ CC or a $\nue$ CC interaction are obtained from a network trained on three million simulated
events. The event selection requirement for an interaction to be included in the $\nue$ CC ($\numu$ CC)
sample is P ($\nue$CC) $>$ 0.85 (P ($\numu$CC) $>$ 0.5), optimized to produce the best sensitivity to CP violation.
Since all of the flavor classification scores must sum to unity, the interactions selected in the two event
selections are completely independent. The same selection criteria are used for both FHC and RHC beam running.
The $\nue$ and $\numu$ selection efficiencies in both FHC and RHC beam modes all exceed 90\% in the neutrino
flux peak.

\section{GLoBES Configuration}
\label{sect:globes}
The GLoBES configuration summarizing the result of the MC-based analysis and facilitating user-generated
sensitivities is provided in the ancillary files in a directory called dune\_globes/.
Cross-section files describing charged-current and neutral-current interactions with argon, generated using
GENIE v2.12.10, with weights applied to match the model choices made in the DUNE simulation, are included in the
configuration.
The true-to-reconstructed smearing matrices and selection efficiency as a function of reconstructed
neutrino energy produced by
the DUNE analysis for various signal
and background modes used by 
GLoBES are included. The selection efficiencies are applied as a ``post-smearing'' efficiency in GLoBES;
i.e., they are applied as a function of reconstructed neutrino energy, such that the configurations
provided reproduce the event rates in Monte Carlo samples generated for
the TDR analysis, including statistical fluctuations.
The naming convention for the channels defined in these files is summarized in
Table~\ref{tab:fastmc_naming_convention}. Note that while smearing and efficiency files are provided in
the configurations for $\nu_\tau$ interactions, the cross-sections for these events are set to zero in the
provided cross-section files, so no $\nu_\tau$ interactions will appear in the event rates when using the
configurations as provided.

\begin{table}[!htb]
  \centering
  \caption{Description of naming convention for channels included in the GLoBES configuration provided in
    ancillary files.
    ``FHC'' and ``RHC'' appear at the beginning of each channel name and
    refer to ``Forward Horn Current'' and ``Reverse Horn Current'' as described in Section~\ref{sect:flux}. Efficiencies are provided
  for both the appearance mode and disappearance mode analyses.}

\end{table}

The GLoBES configuration provided in the ancillary files corresponds to 624 kt-MW-years of exposure: 
6.5 years each of running in neutrino (FHC) and antineutrino (RHC)
mode with a 40-kt fiducial mass far detector, in an 120-GeV, 1.2 MW beam. This is equivalent to ten
years of data collection using the nominal staging assumptions described in \cite{Abi:2020qib}. Conversion between
exposure in kt-MW-years and true years for several nominal exposures is also provided in \cite{Abi:2020qib}.
The sensitivity calculations presented here and in the DUNE nominal analysis \cite{Abi:2020qib}
use oscillation parameters and uncertainties based on the NuFit
4.0\cite{Esteban:2018azc,nufitweb} fit to global neutrino data.
These central values are provided in Table~\ref{tab:oscpar_nufit}.
The matter density is constant and equal to 2.848 $g/cm^{3}$, the average matter density for this baseline
\cite{doi:10.1002/2016JB012887,Roe:2017zdw}.
Figure \ref{fig:spectra} shows the expected DUNE far detector spectra produced by the GLoBES configuration
provided here. These spectra are nearly identical to those produced by the full analysis, as demonstrated in
Fig.~\ref{fig:speccomp}.

\end{figure}

In all cases, oscillation parameters are allowed to vary in the sensitivity calculations.
The mixing angle $\theta_{13}$ and the solar oscillation parameters, $\theta_{12}$ and $\Delta m^2_{12}$,
are constrained by
Gaussian prior functions with widths defined by the uncertainties in Table~\ref{tab:oscpar_nufit}.
The uncertainty on the matter density is taken to be 2\%.
The GLoBES minimization is performed over both possible values for the $\thetatwothree$ octant and,
in the case of CP violation
sensitivity, both possible values for the neutrino mass ordering.

The $\nue$ and $\nuebar$ signal modes have independent normalization 
uncertainties of 2\% each, while the $\numu$ and $\numubar$ signal modes have independent normalization
uncertainties of 5\%.
The background normalization uncertainties range from 5\% to 20\% and
include correlations among various sources of background; the correlations among the background normalization
parameters can be seen by looking at the @sys\_on\_multiex\_errors\_bg parameters in the GLoBES configurations
provided with this posting.
The choices for signal and background normalization uncertainties
may be customized by changing the parameter values in the file definitions.inc.
The treatment of correlation among uncertainties in this configuration
requires use of GLoBES version 3.2.16, available from the GLoBES website\cite{globesweb}.
Note that while the analysis described in the TDR {\it explicitly} includes selected near detector samples,
the normalization uncertainties here were chosen to {\it implicitly} include the effect of the near
detector and so approximate the expected uncertainty after constraints from the near detector are included.

Figure \ref{fig:osc_sens} shows the sensitivity of DUNE's Asimov data to determination
of the neutrino mass ordering and discovery of CP violation, based on the configurations provided here,
assuming an exposure of 624 kt-MW-years. It is important to note that, due to differences in the analysis,
particularly the treatment
of systematic uncertainty, the sensitivity is similar, but not identical, to the official DUNE sensitivity
described in \cite{Abi:2020evt,Abi:2020qib}. The sensitivity curves in Fig.~\ref{fig:osc_sens} are provided only
to assist in validation of user implementation of these configurations.

\section{Summary}
The results of simulations of the LBNF neutrino beamline and a full Monte Carlo simulation and analysis of
expected DUNE far detector neutrino interactions are provided to facilitate phenomenological studies of DUNE
physics sensitivity. The GLoBES configurations provided here produce spectra that are nearly identical to those
used in the nominal DUNE TDR analysis. These configurations produce sensitivity that is similar, but not identical,
to the nominal DUNE TDR analysis for 
neutrino mass ordering and CP violation; the differences are primarily due to a simplified treatment
of systematic uncertainty relative to that in the nominal analysis.
The DUNE collaboration welcomes
those interested in studying DUNE to join the collaboration or to use these configurations independently.
Discussion of any results with the DUNE collaboration, either as a member or a guest, is encouraged. The collaboration
requests that any results making use of the ancillary files reference this arXiv posting and the paper
describing the TDR long-baseline oscillation analysis\cite{Abi:2020qib}.
